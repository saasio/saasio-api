Saasio is a tool that enables multi-tenancy through virtualization
technology (calling cloud platform api ) with tenant management and subscription
managment.  It helps web application and service developers to quickly build
websites for sale or subscription. All you need to do is make an image of your application and
then set up and configure a Saasio site to start selling your application as a service.

When a user's subscription is successful, it automatically creates a VPS from
the image as configured; when the user cancels the subscription and it expires,
it automatically deletes the VPS. Users can login to the site and see their
subscription, host IP information, and other details. Additional extensions can be
added.

# Target Users of Saasio

Saasio is aimed at developers of cloud applications, providing them with a
solution to quickly monetize their applications.

Let's say you develop a nice little web app and open source it to Github.
Developers easily build it and use it on their own, but as the app becomes more
popular, so do non-technical users. But even if they have already made a docker
file, it is still difficult for them.

At this point you may want to provide a cloud hosting version. On the one hand,
you can solve the details of the build for non-technical users, and on the other
hand, hosting can bring some profit, so you can get a financial return.

However, this can create an additional amount of development, and it doesn't
seem wise to spend weeks on development before you know if cloud hosting will be
popular.

Fortunately, the open source Saasio solves this problem, and it only takes
ten minutes to configure and you can get a simple and usable cloud hosting sales
site. It's **immediately ready for early sales**, and you can modify the source code
to add more business-related features as user demand increases. 

Of course, it can also be used to build a third-party sales site under the
license of a cloud application developer. But overall, Saasio is designed
for developers and does not take into account the experience of non-technical
users, so if you don't have a technical background, it's better to use a
Saasio site that someone else has built rather than building it yourself.

PS: Saasio is built on Laravel, and while no knowledge is required for a
simple deployment, if you want to customize and add features, then you need to
have a little Laravel development knowledge.
